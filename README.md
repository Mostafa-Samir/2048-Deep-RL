# 2048 Deep Reinforcement Learning

This is an ***on going*** mini-research project of which the objective is to design a reinforcement learning solution with deep neural networks for the game 2048.

The current approach is based on Google's DQN Algorithm [[1](#ref1)] and the results are still unsuccessful as in all the other attempts made at the problem [[2](#ref2), [3](#ref3), [4](#ref4)].

Another approach using a modified version of DQN for value approximation along with a search component is being investigated in this project as well. Implementation of that approach can be found on the **value-approx** branch.
